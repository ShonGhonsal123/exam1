                 The next wave hit,
                not quite as strong,
                 but still managed to cover the remains of the sandcastle and take more of it away. 
                 The third wave, a big one,
                  crashed over the sandcastle completely covering and engulfing it. 
                 When it receded, there was no trace the sandcastle ever existed and hours of hard work disappeared forever.</p>
